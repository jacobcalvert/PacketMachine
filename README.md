PacketMachine
================================
This little utility can generate lots of traffic for you to flood a particular computer or network with.
A sample copy/paste config is in PacketMachineConfig.txt. The command line is not very robust, hence the 
CLI project that is going on as well. The stats are a little off sometimes but it is a work in progress.
